    "\n",
    "**Moving average:** a moving average is used as a smoothing technique to find a straighter line through data with a lot of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponential smoothing:** is to apply exponentially decreasing weights to the values being averaged over time, giving recent values more weight and older values less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential smoothing originated in the 1950s with **simple exponential smoothing**, \n",
    "which does not allow for a trend or seasonality. Charles Holt advanced the technique \n",
    "in 1957 to allow for a trend with what he called **double exponential smoothing**; and \n",
    "in collaboration with Peter Winters, Holt added seasonality support in 1960, in what is \n",
    "commonly called **Holt-Winters exponential smoothing**. \n"
